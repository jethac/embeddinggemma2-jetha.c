# Contributing

This project serves EmbeddingGemma 2 on CPU and accelerator backends.
See [GOAL.md](GOAL.md) for scope.
The original 300M implementation is retained.

## Before Starting

- Follow `GOAL.md` for experimental port work. Do not contact upstream without
  the user's instruction.
- Keep changes scoped. Do not combine kernel work with unrelated server or
  formatting changes.
- Do not commit GGUF files, model weights, generated benchmark runs, build
  output, or managed XPU dependencies.
- Read `EXTRACTION.md` for llama.cpp algorithm provenance and `PORT_SPEC.md` for
  the fixed graph and backend contract.
- For performance work, read `perf/perf.md` and the current entries in
  `perf/optimization_status.md` before changing a kernel.

The project is MIT licensed. Model acquisition and use are separate from this
repository and remain subject to the model provider's terms.

## Development Setup

Install CMake >=3.24, a C/C++ compiler, Git, Python >=3.9, and NASM (x86).
For video and WebP, add `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to `PATH`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jethac/embeddinggemma2-jetha.c.git
cd embeddinggemma2-jetha.c
python3 scripts/download-model2.py
cmake -S . -B build-cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF -DGGML_METAL=OFF -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF
cmake --build build-cmake --target embeddinggemma2-jetha -j 6
cmake --install build-cmake --prefix local-install
local-install/bin/embeddinggemma2-jetha --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 42667 \
  --backend cpu --model model/embeddinggemma-2-Q8_0.gguf \
  --mmproj model/mmproj-embeddinggemma-2-Q8_0.gguf
```

For Windows/macOS CPU audio, set `EI_CPU_AUDIO_F16_2=1` (+270 MiB).
For text only, omit `--mmproj`. Use a separate build directory for each backend.

| Platform | Changes to the commands above |
|---|---|
| Windows | Use MSYS2 MinGW64, `python`, `-G Ninja`, and the `.exe` suffix. |
| CUDA | Install the CUDA toolkit and driver. Add `-DGGML_CUDA=ON`. Start with `--backend cuda`. |
| Metal | On macOS, replace `-DGGML_METAL=OFF` with `-DGGML_METAL=ON -DGGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=ON`. Start with `--backend metal`. |

The cache path and Make commands below apply to the original 300M implementation.

The default model path is:

```text
${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/embeddinggemma.c/embeddinggemma-300M-qat-Q4_0.gguf
```

The server can populate that cache with `curl` or `wget`. Tests use `MODEL`, so
an existing file can be selected explicitly:

```sh
make test MODEL=/path/to/embeddinggemma-300M-qat-Q4_0.gguf
```

Common requirements are a C11 compiler, `make`, POSIX threads, Python 3, and a
local model. Backend toolchains are platform-specific:

| backend | required toolchain/runtime |
|---|---|
| CPU | Clang or GCC |
| Metal | full Xcode with the Metal Toolchain component |
| CUDA | CUDA toolkit, cuBLAS, and a supported NVIDIA driver |
| ROCm | ROCm HIP, hipBLAS, and an AMDGPU runtime |
| XPU SYCL | Intel oneAPI DPC++, oneMKL, and Level Zero |

Run `make help` for the current build, test, performance, and release targets.

## Code Map

- `src/engine.c` and `src/kernels.c`: portable CPU graph and kernels.
- `src/engine_metal.m` and `src/metal/`: Metal host code and kernel families.
- `src/engine_cuda.cu`: CUDA engine and kernels.
- `src/engine_rocm.hip`: ROCm engine and kernels.
- `src/engine_xpu*.cpp`: portable SYCL and specialized Xe2 routes.
- `src/inference_service.c`: batching, tokenization, singleflight, and result
  caching.
- `src/server.c`: HTTP transport, request parsing, and response caching.
- `perf/`: native harnesses, Python runners, retained results, and experiment
  decisions.

Prefer the existing backend boundary and model-specialized shapes over generic
abstractions. Shared behavior belongs in the portable engine only when all
backends can preserve the same contract.

## Build And Test

### Build targets

Build the portable CPU server:

```sh
make
```

The output is `build/embeddinggemma`. The CPU route includes scalar C, ARM64
NEON, AVX2, and SSSE3 kernels and selects the best available implementation at
runtime.

Build the self-contained Metal server:

```sh
make metal
```

The output is `build/embeddinggemma-metal`. The build compiles a portable Metal
3.1 library and a Metal 4 tensor/flash library, then embeds them in Mach-O
`__DATA,__metallib` and `__DATA,__metal4lib` sections. The corresponding files
under `build/` are inspection intermediates, not runtime sidecars. The runtime
selects Metal 4 on supported GPUs and keeps the Metal 3.1 path for older Apple
Silicon. Building the fast path requires Xcode 26 or newer; Darwin executables
still default to `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0`.

Build the portable CUDA server:

```sh
make cuda NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
```

The output is `build/embeddinggemma-cuda`. The default release-style build
contains native code for every architecture reported by the installed CUDA
compiler plus PTX for its newest target. Use `CUDA_ARCHS=86` only for a focused
developer build.

Build the portable ROCm server:

```sh
make rocm HIPCC=/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc
```

The output is `build/embeddinggemma-rocm`. The default fat binary covers
`gfx908`, `gfx90a`, `gfx942`, and `gfx950`. `ROCM_ARCHS="gfx90a gfx942"` or the
legacy `ROCM_ARCH=gfx942` may reduce local build time but must not be used for a
release.

Build the Intel XPU SYCL server:

```sh
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
make xpu XPU_XE2_FLASH=1 SYCL_CXX=icpx
```

The output is `build/embeddinggemma-xpu`. `XPU_XE2_FLASH=1` fetches the pinned
`vllm-xpu-kernels` and SYCL-TLA revisions into `.xpu-deps` and enables the Xe2
FlashAttention and packed-W4 routes. `make xpu-deps` fetches those dependencies
without building.

Each accelerator binary defaults to its compiled backend. `--backend cpu` is a
diagnostic override; `--backend auto` requests fallback behavior.

### Xcode and Metal

Metal compilation requires full Xcode and the separately installed Metal
Toolchain component. Command Line Tools alone are insufficient.

```sh
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

Verify the selected toolchain before diagnosing the Makefile:

```sh
xcode-select -p
xcodebuild -version
xcodebuild -showComponent MetalToolchain -json
xcrun --find metal
xcrun metal --version
```

The component status must be `installed`. If the command-line download cannot
reach Apple's catalog, install **Metal Toolchain** from **Xcode > Settings >
Components**, then ensure `xcode-select` points at that Xcode installation. The
Makefile prefers `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` through
`DEVELOPER_DIR` when no explicit value is supplied.

### Test matrix

CPU changes must pass:

```sh
make clean-cpu
make test
```

Backend changes must pass the complete suite on matching hardware:

```sh
make test-metal
make test-cuda NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc CUDA_ARCHS=86
make test-rocm HIPCC=/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc ROCM_ARCHS=gfx942
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
make test-xpu XPU_XE2_FLASH=1 SYCL_CXX=icpx
```

Architecture overrides above are for fast local validation. Release builds
must use the portable architecture sets in `RELEASE.md`.

Every inference change must retain:

- Exact tokenizer output against checked-in vectors.
- Cosine similarity of at least `0.999` against llama.cpp embedding goldens.
- Backend drift and packed-batch thresholds enforced by the backend suite.
- Correct HTTP output at 768, 512, 256, and 128 Matryoshka dimensions.
- Bounded queue, workspace, and client-batch behavior.

Run the shell checks after changing scripts or release tooling:

```sh
make check
```

The suites validate the GGUF manifest, tokenizer vectors, quantized kernels,
full and sliding-window attention, fused routes, ten llama.cpp embedding
goldens, packed batches, and all Matryoshka dimensions. Release acceptance is
cosine similarity of at least `0.999` against llama.cpp. Backend-specific
synthetic drift thresholds are additional regression guards, not replacements
for that acceptance test.

## Backend Implementation Notes

### CPU

The CPU engine uses Q4_0 x Q8_0 projection kernels with scalar, NEON, AVX2, and
SSSE3 implementations; SIMD quantization, normalization, elementwise, and
attention kernels; and a persistent pthread pool. Retained model-specific
fusions include Q/K norm plus RoPE, triple QKV projection, adjacent three-row
projection, RMS norm plus Q8 activation quantization, and a four-activation-row
projection route for large flattened batches.

Diagnostic controls:

- `EI_THREADS`: override the CPU worker count.
- `EI_CPU_SHORT_THREADS`: override the short-projection worker width.
- `EI_CPU_DUAL_PROJECTION`: control paired projection accumulation.
- `EI_CPU_FUSED_RMS_QUANT=0`: materialize normalized activations before Q8.
- `EI_CPU_MULTIROW_MIN_TOKENS=0..65536`: disable or move the multirow boundary.
- `EI_CPU_FUSED_GELU_QUANT=1`: enable the rejected fused activation experiment.
- `EI_CPU_AUDIO_F16_2=1`: replace the 132 Gemma4 audio Conformer Q8_0
  matrices with F16 at load time, avoiding Q8 activation rounding. Default
  OFF; applies only to a loaded CPU audio encoder. Adds 270 MiB of weights
  and separates the numeric cache domain. Output projections remain Q8_0.
  Windows scalar, AVX-only (without F16C), AVX2 and AVX-512, plus macOS
  ARM CPU, passed the original FP32 audio checks. Other CPU platforms
  require qualification.

### Metal

Metal 3.1 uses one-row direct Q4 GEMV at T=1..6 and four-row direct Q4 GEMV from
T=7. On Metal 4 GPUs, Q4 tensor matmul takes over at 64 flattened tokens with
combined QKV and up/gate dispatches. Model-specific flash attention starts at
128 tokens for one sequence and 192 tokens in packed batches; it uses FP16 K/V
with FP32 softmax and output accumulation. Retained portable fusions cover Q/K
norm plus RoPE, residual plus next RMS norm, and final norm/pooling. RoPE tables
are precomputed.

Diagnostic controls:

- `EI_METALLIB_PATH`: load an alternate metallib for kernel experiments.
- `EI_METAL4LIB_PATH`: load an alternate Metal 4 fast-path library.
- `EI_METAL_TENSOR_MM_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move the tensor-matmul boundary.
- `EI_METAL_FLASH_ATTN_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move single-sequence flash attention.
- `EI_METAL_FLASH_ATTN_BATCH_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move packed flash attention.
- `EI_METAL_FUSED_QK_ROPE=0`: restore separate Q and K dispatches.
- `EI_METAL_GEMV_R4_MIN_TOKENS=1..64`: move the R1/R4 boundary.
- `EI_METAL_GEMM_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: enable staged GEMM at a threshold.
- `EI_METAL_GEMM_TILE_TOKENS=8|16`: select the staged tile.
- `EI_METAL_FP16_KV_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move the FP16 K/V boundary.
- `EI_METAL_FUSED_RESIDUAL_NEXT_NORM=0`: disable residual/next-norm fusion.
- `EI_METAL_FUSED_RESIDUAL_NEXT_MAX_TOKENS=1..65536`: move its upper boundary.
- `EI_METAL_FUSED_UP_GATE_GELU=1`: enable the rejected fused FFN experiment.
- `EI_METAL_FUSED_UP_GATE_ROWS=2|4`: select its row grouping.
- `EI_METAL_TRIPLE_QKV_GEMV=1`: enable the rejected short QKV experiment.

### CUDA

CUDA uses fused RMS plus Q8 activation quantization and packed Q4_0 x Q8_0
`dp4a` projections at T=1..4. Larger batches use weights expanded once at model
load and cuBLAS FP16 tensor-core GEMM with FP32 accumulation. Combined QKV and
up/gate GEMMs, direct FP16 QKV epilogues, shared-tile online attention,
tensor-core QK/PV, symmetric-SWA query bands, and CUDA graph replay are retained.

Diagnostic controls:

- `EI_CUDA_DEVICE=0..N`: select the CUDA device.
- `EI_CUDA_GEMM_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move the direct/tensor-core boundary.
- `EI_CUDA_Q8_LATENCY=0|1`: select FP32 Q4 or fused Q8/DP4A at short lengths.
- `EI_CUDA_FP16_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS=1..65536`: move FP16 attention storage.
- `EI_CUDA_DIRECT_FP16_QKV=0|1`: control the combined direct QKV epilogue.
- `EI_CUDA_DIRECT_FP16_CONTEXT=0|1`: control direct FP16 context output.
- `EI_CUDA_FLASH_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS` and
  `EI_CUDA_FLASH_ATTENTION_MAX_TOKENS`: bound shared-tile attention.
- `EI_CUDA_TENSOR_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS`: override the batch-aware crossover.
- `EI_CUDA_SWA_TENSOR_TILE_TOKENS=0|128|256|512|1024`: select SWA banding.
- `EI_CUDA_SWA_TENSOR_MIN_TOKENS`: move the banded-SWA boundary.
- `EI_CUDA_NATIVE_Q4_GEMM=0|1`: enable the experimental packed-Q4 MMA route.
- `EI_CUDA_W4A8_GEMM=0|1|2`: opt-in hand-written per-block int8 projection GEMM
  (Q4 weight x int8 activation on the IMMA tensor cores; keeps native Q4 nibbles
  and per-32-block scales via a cp.async double-buffered kernel). Beats cuBLAS
  fp16 1.0-1.41x on the projections but ~3% end-to-end (T>=1024); `2` limits it
  to the two decisive projections. Default off; batch self-parity ~0.997.
- `EI_CUDA_INT8_ATTN=0|1|2`: opt-in int8 flash attention. `1` = int8 Q.K^T
  (accuracy-safe, ~3% at T>=1024, route parity tightens to ~0.998); `2` also
  int8 P.V, which breaks accuracy and is not for use. Default off.

### ROCm

ROCm keeps packed Q4 weights resident and also expands them to FP16 for large
hipBLAS GEMMs. Direct packed-wave kernels serve short requests, native Q4 MFMA
serves the middle range, and hipBLAS serves large batches. Retained routes
include combined projections, residual/next-RMS fusion, a fused MFMA FFN
epilogue, FP16 attention storage, batched GQA tensor attention, and exact V-only
attention for independent one-token sequences.

Diagnostic controls:

- `EI_ROCM_DEVICE=0..N`: select the HIP device.
- `EI_ROCM_GEMM_MIN_TOKENS`: move the direct/native boundary.
- `EI_ROCM_SINGLETON_DIRECT_MAX_TOKENS`: move the singleton direct ceiling.
- `EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_GEMM` and `EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_MAX_TOKENS`: control MFMA.
- `EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_FUSED` and `EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_FUSED_ACTIVATION`: control
  combined MFMA projections and their FFN epilogue.
- `EI_ROCM_FP16_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS`: move FP16 attention storage.
- `EI_ROCM_TENSOR_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS`: override dense attention routing.
- `EI_ROCM_BATCHED_TENSOR_ATTENTION`: control batched GQA tensor calls.
- `EI_ROCM_FP16_ATTENTION_SCORES`: control FP16 dense score storage.
- `EI_ROCM_SWA_TENSOR_TILE_TOKENS`: select or disable SWA query banding.
- `EI_ROCM_DIRECT_FP16_CONTEXT` and `EI_ROCM_RMS_REGISTER_CACHE`: control
  retained conversion and residual/RMS fusions.
- `EI_ROCM_SINGLE_TOKEN_V_ONLY`, `EI_ROCM_SINGLETON_METADATA_ELISION`, and
  `EI_ROCM_FINAL_SINGLETON_POOL`: control singleton fast paths.
- `EI_ROCM_DIRECT_RMS_FUSION`, `EI_ROCM_DIRECT_Q4_PAIR`, and
  `EI_ROCM_FUSED_EMBEDDING_RMS`: control direct-route launch reductions.

Rejected ROCm experiments remain behind `EI_ROCM_COMMAND_GRAPH`,
`EI_ROCM_MFMA_ATTENTION`, `EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_WIDE`,
`EI_ROCM_NATIVE_Q4_DIRECT_FP16_QKV`, `EI_ROCM_DIRECT_Q4_QUAD`, and
`EI_ROCM_PINNED_IO_STAGING` for architecture-specific retesting.

### XPU SYCL

XPU keeps model/workspace allocations resident, expands Q4_0 weights to FP16
once, and uses oneMKL XMX GEMM with combined projections. It includes fused
FP16 QKV norm/RoPE, batch-aware online/dense attention, one-token V-only
attention, cooperative RMS and pooling, Xe2 FlashAttention, and a specialized
Xe2 W4 route.

Diagnostic controls:

- `EI_XPU_DEVICE=0..N`: select the Level Zero device.
- `EI_XPU_TENSOR_ATTENTION_MIN_TOKENS`: override dense attention routing.
- `EI_XPU_FP16_ATTENTION=0|1|auto`: control FP16 Q/K/V storage.
- `EI_XPU_SINGLE_TOKEN_V_ONLY=0|1`: control singleton V-only attention.
- `EI_XPU_COOPERATIVE_RMS_MAX_ROWS`: move the cooperative RMS boundary.
- `EI_XPU_RMS_REGISTER_CACHE=0|1`: control register-cached residual/RMS.
- `EI_XPU_COOPERATIVE_POOL=0|1|auto`: control cooperative final pooling.
- `EI_XPU_XE2_FLASH=0|1|auto`: control the Xe2 Flash route.
- `EI_XPU_XE2_FLASH_MIN_TOKENS` and `EI_XPU_XE2_FLASH_BATCH_MIN_TOKENS`: move
  its single and packed-batch thresholds.
- `EI_XPU_Q4_M_TILED=1`: enable direct-Q4 M2-M8 weight reuse diagnostics.
- `EI_XPU_COMMAND_GRAPH=0|1|auto`: control exact-shape graph replay.
- `EI_XPU_FUSE_ATTN_OUTPUT_HALF=0|1`: opt-in fusion that writes the online-
  attention context as half inline, skipping a separate float-to-half
  submission before the attn-output GEMM (+2-5% p50, submission-bound regime).
  Default off; bit-identical on its active path.
- `EI_XPU_XE2_W4=0|1`: control the Xe2 W4A16 up/gate route.
- `XPU_ONEDNN=1`, `EI_XPU_ONEDNN_F16=1`, and `EI_XPU_ONEDNN_W4=1`: build and
  select rejected oneDNN experiments.

Route defaults were selected on the hardware recorded in
`perf/optimization_status.md`. Re-benchmark before changing them for another
GPU generation.

## Runtime And Serving

The canonical HTTP port is `42666`. The original `/api/embed` route and the
additive OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` route share one inference service;
their response-cache keys are format-namespaced. `--bind`, `--port`, and
`--model` override the listener and model path. The default model path is
documented above; resolution order is `--model`, `EI_MODEL_PATH`, then that
cache path.

Important production controls:

- `--workers N` and `--max-queue N`: bound HTTP concurrency and backlog.
- `--cache-entries N`: set final-embedding LRU capacity.
- `--max-batch-tokens N` and `--max-batch-requests N`: set packed batch limits.
- `--max-batch-sequence-tokens N`: cap sequences eligible for packing.
- `--max-client-batch-size N`: bound one HTTP request's input array.
- `--tokenizer-workers N`: set persistent tokenizer workers.
- `--batch-wait-us N`: bound microbatch collection delay.
- `--keepalive-connections N`, `--keepalive-max-requests N`, and
  `--keepalive-timeout-ms N`: control persistent HTTP connections.
- `--response-cache-mb N`: size the exact float-JSON response LRU.
- `--persistent-cache-path PATH`: persist the exact-embedding cache to disk.
  The service loads matching entries at startup and flushes ready entries on
  graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT), so re-indexing and eval workloads survive
  restarts as cache hits instead of recomputing from cold. The file is guarded
  by a model fingerprint (size + first 64 KiB); a cache from a different model
  or build is ignored, never served. Writes are atomic (temp file + rename);
  a hard kill (SIGKILL) simply loses the current session's new entries.
- `EI_BATCH_LOOKAHEAD=0`: restore strict FIFO batching for diagnostics.
- `EI_ADAPTIVE_BATCH_WAIT=0`: always apply the configured collection delay.
- `EI_BATCH_WAVE=0`: disable demand-aware wave collection. By default the
  scheduler tracks the peak number of concurrently in-flight requests since
  the previous dispatch and both keeps collecting while more clients are in
  flight than queued and dispatches the moment the queue reaches that peak.
- `EI_BATCH_WAIT_MAX_US=N`: cap the extended collection deadline. New arrivals
  during collection extend the base `--batch-wait-us` deadline, bounded by
  this cap; the default is four times the base delay.
- `EI_SOLO_INLINE=0`: disable inline execution of solo requests. By default a
  request that arrives with an idle backend, an empty queue, and an expected
  wave of one executes on the submitting worker thread, skipping two thread
  handoffs; concurrent traffic still routes through the batch collector.
- `EI_HTTP_KEEPALIVE=0`: disable persistent HTTP connections.

The inference owner preallocates token/output buffers, and accelerator engines
reserve production workspace before listening. HTTP admission, client batch
size, and backend batch size are deliberately separate bounds.

The canonical embedding cache key is the exact token-ID sequence. Concurrent
duplicates coalesce onto one execution; completed 768-dimensional embeddings
are retained and all Matryoshka dimensions reuse that entry. The server-level
response LRU additionally caches exact float-JSON response bodies. Transformer
prefix KV caching is invalid for EmbeddingGemma's bidirectional attention: a
prefix state changes when later tokens are present.

## Performance Changes

Treat optimization as an experiment, not an intuition-only change:

1. Record the machine, compiler, driver, commit, shapes, warmups, and iteration
   count.
2. Establish a same-process or alternating-order baseline.
3. Change one bottleneck hypothesis at a time.
4. Run correctness before trusting timing data.
5. Retain low-risk changes only when the representative gain is stable and at
   least 3%; document useful neutral and rejected experiments too.
6. Measure single requests, packed batches, and service concurrency. Include
   token lengths 1, 32, 512, and 2048 where the route applies.
7. Append each pass and its decision to `perf/optimization_status.md`.

Raw machine-specific runs belong under ignored `perf/results/`. Summaries that
justify retained behavior belong in the tracked optimization log.

Useful entry points:

```sh
make perf
make perf-engine
make perf-engine-metal
make perf-engine-cuda
make perf-engine-rocm
make perf-engine-xpu XPU_XE2_FLASH=1
make perf-concurrency
make perf-concurrency-cuda
make perf-concurrency-rocm
make perf-concurrency-xpu XPU_XE2_FLASH=1
make perf-batch
make perf-tokenization

python3 perf/bench_engine.py --backend both --tokens 1,7,32,128,512,2048
python3 perf/bench_concurrency.py --backend both --tokens 32 \
  --concurrency 1,2,4,8,16,32
python3 perf/bench_dimensions.py --backend metal --encoding-format both
python3 perf/bench_http.py --backend metal --keepalive on --response-cache-mb 64
```

The detailed measurement protocol, shape priorities, concurrency rules, and
Matryoshka methodology are in `perf/perf.md`. Every run writes structured data
under `perf/results/`; append only durable decisions and representative numbers
to `perf/optimization_status.md`.

## Style

- Keep portable code at C11. Backend translation units may use Objective-C,
  CUDA C++, HIP C++, or SYCL C++ as required.
- Preserve `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` cleanliness for host C code.
- Use ASCII unless an existing file requires otherwise.
- Add comments only for non-obvious invariants, synchronization, numerical
  choices, or architecture constraints.
- Avoid new runtime dependencies unless they are available on every supported
  deployment or isolated to an optional backend.

## Pull Requests

Describe the behavioral change, hardware and toolchain used, exact test
commands, correctness result, and before/after performance for kernel work.
Call out untested backends explicitly. Do not update `VERSION`, create a tag,
or change pinned install examples unless the release owner has approved the
exact next version.

Release procedure and artifact acceptance are defined in `RELEASE.md`.
